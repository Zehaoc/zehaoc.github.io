excerpt: 'High Dynamic Range (HDR) video reconstruction seeks to
accurately restore the extensive dynamic range present in
real-world scenes and is widely employed in downstream
applications. Existing methods typically operate on one or
a small number of consecutive frames, which often leads
to inconsistent brightness across the video due to their limited
perspective on the video sequence. Moreover, supervised
learning-based approaches are susceptible to data bias, resulting
in reduced effectiveness when confronted with test inputs
exhibiting a domain gap relative to the training data. To
address these limitations, we present an event-guided HDR
video reconstruction method through building 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), to ensure consistent brightness imposed
by 3D consistency.We introduce HDR 3D Gaussians capable
of simultaneously representing HDR and low-dynamic-range
(LDR) colors. Furthermore, we incorporate a learnable HDRto-
LDR transformation optimized by input event streams and
LDR frames to eliminate the data bias. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.'
