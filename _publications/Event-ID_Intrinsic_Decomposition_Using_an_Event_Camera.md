excerpt: Reconstructing 3D scenes from multi-view images is challenging,
especially under extreme scenarios.We propose Event-ID, an eventbased
intrinsic decomposition framework that leverages events
and images for stable decomposition under extreme scenarios. Our
method is based on two observations, event cameras maintain
good imaging quality under blurry or poorly exposed scenarios,
and event signals from different viewpoints exhibit similarity in
diffuse regions while varying in specular regions. We establish
an event-based reflectance model and introduce an event-based
warping method to extract specular clues. Our two-stage framework
constructs a radiance field and decomposes the scene into normal,
material, and lighting. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.'
