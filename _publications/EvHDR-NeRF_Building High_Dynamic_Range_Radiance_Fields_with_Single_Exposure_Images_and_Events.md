excerpt: 'We present EvHDR-NeRF to recover a High Dynamic Range
(HDR) radiance field from event streams and a set of Low
Dynamic Range (LDR) views with single exposures. Using
the EvHDR-NeRF, we can generate both novel HDR views
and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to
our method is to model the new relationship between events
streams and LDR images, which considers both the Camera
Response Function (CRF) and exposure time. Based on this
relationship, we categorize events into inter-frame events and
intra-exposure. The former is utilized for building HDR radiance
field and the latter is used to deblur potentially blurred
images. Compared to existing methods, this method can effectively
reconstruct the HDR radiance field even when the
input images are degraded. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction,
providing a more adaptable and accurate solution for
complex imaging applications.'
