excerpt: 'In the domain of space-time video super-resolution, it is
typically challenging to handle complex motions (including
large and nonlinear motions) and varying illumination scenes
due to the lack of inter-frame information. Leveraging the
dense temporal information provided by event signals offers
a promising solution. Traditional event-based methods typically
rely on multiple images, using motion estimation and
compensation, which can introduce errors. Accumulated errors
from multiple frames often lead to artifacts and blurriness
in the output. To mitigate these issues, we propose EvSTVSR,
a method that uses fewer adjacent frames and integrates dense
temporal information from events to guide alignment. Additionally,
we introduce a coordinate-based feature fusion upsampling
module to achieve spatial super-resolution. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms
existing RGB-based approaches but also excels in
handling large motion scenarios.'
